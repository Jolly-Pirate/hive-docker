# MIRA NOTES:
# MIRA files do not use `shared-file-size`
# Memory replay is literally in RAM and not a memory mapped file
# Don't set shared-file-dir anymore, the rocksdb files will be in /blockchain on disk
# The plugins follow* tags* are deprecated https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitdev/upcoming-changes-to-api-steemit-com
# Use account_history, not account_history_rocksdb (which can probably be deprecated after more testing of the ‘old’ account history with MIRA since with MIRA all plugins will already use rocksdb
